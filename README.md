10 PRINT

Written in
- Python 3.5.2
- Pygame 1.9.3

This app is based on the 10 PRINT book: https://10print.org/

It was inspired by a YouTuber (Daniel Shiffman): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs

He programs it in p5.js (JavaScript). I followed along with the video translating everything into Python, using Pygame and a 'package' that I made to mimic some of the p5.js/ Processing commands.
